cerebro is an open source(MIT License) elasticsearch web admin tool built using Scala, Play Framework, AngularJS and Bootstrap.

### Requirements

cerebro needs Java 1.8 or newer to run.

### Installation
- Download from [https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro/releases](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro/releases)

### Docker

You can find the official docker images in the official [docker hub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmenezes/cerebro/).

Visit [cerebro-docker](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro-docker) for further information. 

### Configuration

#### HTTP server address and port
You can run cerebro listening on a different host and port(defaults to 0.0.0.0:9000):

```
bin/cerebro -Dhttp.port=1234 -Dhttp.address=127.0.0.1
```

#### LDAP config

LDAP can be configured using environment variables. If you typically run cerebro using docker,
you can pass a file with all the env vars. The file would look like:

```bash
# Set it to ldap to activate ldap authorization
AUTH_TYPE=ldap

# Your ldap url
LDAP_URL=ldap://exammple.com:389

LDAP_BASE_DN=OU=users,DC=example,DC=com

# Usually method should  be "simple" otherwise, set it to the SASL mechanisms
LDAP_METHOD=simple

# user-template executes a string.format() operation where
# username is passed in first, followed by base-dn. Some examples
#  - %s => leave user untouched
#  - %s@domain.com => append "@domain.com" to username
#  - uid=%s,%s => usual case of OpenLDAP
LDAP_USER_TEMPLATE=%s@example.com

# User identifier that can perform searches
LDAP_BIND_DN=admin@example.com
LDAP_BIND_PWD=adminpass

# Group membership settings (optional)

# If left unset LDAP_BASE_DN will be used
# LDAP_GROUP_BASE_DN=OU=users,DC=example,DC=com

# Attribute that represent the user, for example uid or mail
# LDAP_USER_ATTR=mail

# Filter that tests membership of the group. If this property is empty then there is no group membership check
# AD example => memberOf=CN=mygroup,ou=ouofthegroup,DC=domain,DC=com
# OpenLDAP example => CN=mygroup
# LDAP_GROUP=memberOf=memberOf=CN=mygroup,ou=ouofthegroup,DC=domain,DC=com

```

You can the pass this file as argument using:

```bash
 docker run -p 9000:9000 --env-file env-ldap  lmenezes/cerebro
```


#### Other settings

Other settings are exposed through the **conf/application.conf** file found on the application directory.

It is also possible to use an alternate configuration file defined on a different location:

```
bin/cerebro -Dconfig.file=/some/other/dir/alternate.conf
```
